# 999 Etudes

## To do

- [ ] Add additional templates for different score classes:
    - [âœ“] Percussion scores
- [ ] Settle on additional parameter sets for different score classes:
    - [ ] Percussion scores
    - [ ] "Easy" scores
    - [ ] "Hard" scores
- [ ] Tweak visual appearance of scores
- [ ] Settle on final text to be included at bottom of each score


## Description

This is a utility used to procedurally generate scores for short etudes.

The intended use is in generating large batches of etudes for "999 etudes", an "improvisation simulator" centering one-time-use disposable etudes which will be conspicuously destroyed after performance.

## Use

Running ``make.sh`` without any additional parameters will generate one score based on the parameters given in ``parameters.yaml``.

To generate multiple scores with the same set of parameters, provide the desired number, e.g. ``make.sh 5``.

Details pertaining to score generation will be printed in the console. Each score will be generated separately in a time-stamped directory, then merged into a final pdf.

### Parameters

Parameters for generation are given in the included ``parameters.yaml`` file.
